## Objective 

To create an employee directory, a table of random users, using react with data gathered from an API.

## Installation

Run npm install then npm run start

## Functionality

Once on the browser a search bar and a table filled with random user data is shown. You can search by letters or name to get a filtered result of the data shown. The user can also click on first name or last name to get an alphabetically sorted list.

## Challenges/Improvements

Github pages was a nightmare to get working for me. It took four repos and a lot of struggles but it currently is working how it should. I'm not sure why but it seems to glitch sometimes and you may have to refresh or leave the github pages link and go back to it for it to work.
